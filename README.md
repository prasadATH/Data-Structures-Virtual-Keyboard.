# Data-Structures-Virtual-Keyboard.
Determines the  optimal series of moves to enter a string into a virtual keyboard. Movement is limited to  up|down|left|right and selecting a key. Some keyboards have modes to enter upper/lowercase and  numbers/punctuation. They also can wrap around the left|right|top|bottom or be limited at the  edges.
